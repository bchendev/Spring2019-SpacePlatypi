### Overview

We like to think of this web app like social media backwards. Instead of making connections based off of who you know, you search the different communities you are a part of for interests, hobbies, classes, etc. that you share with others. If you and another person share an interest and a community, you can connect to grow in together in that aspect in a shared platform!
